# Family Advisory Council Notes

## Condensed Notes

## Raw Notes

- Alexa, voice activated? Too expensive?

- can't process too much information
- after going home, you have questions, but you can't call your doctor; go to google, but that's not as good.

- difficult to get a feel for the progression of the problem, what potential treaments, what potential issues
- very predictable stuff, but you don't see it
- "Tell me what's possible on the horizon (even if it will never happen)"

- you need your own strategic plan, meet in a year (maybe more frequent), make a longer plan with your doc.

- Connecting families -> see someone farther along the recovery track, get some reassurance

- recommending goals to school? need different expectations for school professionals (speech therapists, teachers)

- lot of info (absolute) -> the vehicle is more important (tacticle, oral, visual, audio)
  - for one woman, paper was useless, she did better with a physical doll.

- when to process info?

- how does this impact me at home? every 2 hours, other times? WTF is going to happen?

- ability to discern similar info with different vocabulary used
- only 5 minutes with the new doctor
- differences between language used from team to team

- nurse had a huge binder...what am I supposed to do?
  - this is a LOT of info
  - my whole life is going to change?
  - how does that feel?
  - what am I supposed to do?

- pediatrician was helpful with translating the medical jargon
- could advocate for patient, especially while the family was in shock
  - (seems like we should connect the pediatrician, or mock some of these "features")

- repository of info
- remember where the info is
- giving them an *anchor* is important

- would be nice to have a patient advocate
- someone you can complain to, not someone providing service to your child
- could help with problems with the hospital
  - "why this, why is the doctor so fast"
  - don't want to complain to the chain of command (fear of causing problems)

- grief counselor -> guage readiness of parent to receive information

- could find real, vetted information (review, good info) (at 2 AM, when parents are going crazy)
- every stagebrings new info, need to find real info
- database of some sort?
- articles detailing methodologies

- each department count have their own microsite?
- could I subscribe to the page?
- do I need to think about key dates?

- add requests for information on <TOPIC> that's missing
- what about anecdotal evidence...**how do you keep fear to a minimum?**
- think about audience -> not able to read scientific articles
  - language barriers, reading level, how to get value out of this complicated chunk of information
  - videos, YouTube, 15 sec clips?
  - investigate alternative delivery methods
- sometimes the self-moderated websites are very high quality because they care so deeply

- investigate patientslikeme.com

- remember email fatigue, notification fatigue, etc.
