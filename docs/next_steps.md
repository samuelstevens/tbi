# Next Steps

(This document will be distilled into an email sent to Kedar and Chrissie)

- What are some of the problems we see?
- Who can we help?

## What problems do we see?

- Overwhelming amount of information in difficult to understand formats. This includes method of delivery, vocabulary, time needed to process, emotional wellbeing needed to process, etc.
- Getting access information after leaving the hospital. Not having a contact can make it difficult to answer small questions. This could be remedied with a general care physician, another family in a similar situation, an online repository of information, a way to contact the original doctors, etc.
- Planning for the future. The information provided at the hospital doesn't include how to grieve, what changes are expected at home and in daily life, future steps, a strategic plan for both the child and the family, etc.
- Social structure after leaving the hospital. Especially in TBI, it can feel like you're alone in the world. Having access to other families going through similar struggles would help both the parents and the children. 

## Who can we help?

The initial focus was children suffering from TBI. After comparing notes from the Family Advisory Council and the Young Survivors Group, it's clear that many of the complaints from the FAC and YSG were similar. This means that we could hope to expand past 25 families a year with children who have TBI to a much larger population, perhaps including everyone who is a patient at Children's. However, TBI patients are an excellent, focused area to start with.

Our next steps would involve persona-based design, a software design technique aimed at making intuitive and actually useful software. We would then move into the developer cycle where we loop through plan, implement, evaluate, until we reach a suitable point for the project.

Do we want to move forward with this project? What information can we provide to make the decision easier?

Thanks,

Sam
